// This class just implements super sampling. Super sampling looks fantastic but is quite expensive.
// 8x and beyond values can start to eat ridiculous amounts of memory / gpu time, for less and less noticable returns
// 4x works and looks great
// values such as 3 are also possible, that works out 9 samples per pixel
// The algorithm is super simple, just add up all samples and divide by the number
