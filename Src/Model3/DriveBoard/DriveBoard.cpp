/*
 * DriveBoard.cpp
 *
 * Implementation of the CDriveBoard class: drive board (force feedback)
 * emulation.
 *
 * NOTE: Simulation does not yet work. Drive board ROMs are required.
 *
 * State Management:
 * -----------------
 * - IsAttached: This indicates whether the drive board is present for the game
 *   and should be emulated, if possible. It is determined by whether a ROM was
 *   passed to the initializer. Entirely simulated implementations of the drive
 *   board should still take a ROM, even if it contains no data. The attached
 *   should be set only *once* at initialization and preferably by the base
 *   CDriveBoard class. Do not change this flag during run-time!
 * - Disabled: This state indicates emulation should not proceed. Force
 *   feedback must be completely halted. This flag is used only to disable the
 *   board due to run-time errors and must *not* be re-enabled. It must not be
 *   used to "temporarily" disable the board. Only the Reset() method may
 *   enable emulation and then only if the board is attached. A valid reason
 *   for disabling the board during run-time is e.g., if a loaded save state is
 *   incompatible (wrong format or because it was saved while the board was
 *   disabled, rendering its state data invalid).
 * - IsDisabled: This method is used internally only and should be used to test
 *   whether emulation should occur. It is the combination of attachment and
 *   enabled state.
 * - Disable: Use this to disable the board. Drive board implementations should
 *   override this to send stop commands to force feedback motors and then call
 *   CDriveBoard::Disable() to update the disabled flag.
